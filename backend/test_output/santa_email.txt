🎅 Ho ho ho, Emma! What a joy it was to read your lovely letter all the way here at the North Pole! You've been quite the helper this year, lending a hand with the dishes and being a wonderful sister—how splendid!

I'm thrilled to let you know that your Christmas wishes, from the unicorn stuffed animal to your art supplies and those fascinating animal books, are being looked after with great care by the elves. 🦄📚 They're working hard to ensure your dreams come true!

Here's a little magical job for you this week: why not create a drawing to surprise someone in your family? I promise it will bring lots of smiles! 🖍️🎨

Thank you in advance for the cookies and milk you promised… Delicious! 🍪🥛 Please be sure you're snuggled up in bed on Christmas Eve, ready for dreams filled with wonder as I glide across the sky with my reindeer. 🦌✨

Merry Christmas, little friend! ☃️❤️

Love from the North Pole,
Santa & The Elves 🎅🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️
